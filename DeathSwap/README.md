# DeathSwap
Deathswap Is A Game Where Two Players Duke It Out, Trying To Be The Last One Alive Without PvP. Randomly, Every 5 Minutes, The Players Will Switch Positions, Without Any Warning. The Aim Is To Put Yourself In A Position That Would Result In Your Opponent's Death, Should A Swap Occur. It's That Easy! Try To Kill Your Opponent With A Simple Trap, Like Holding Shift Over Lava, Or With Something More Intricate. Like Pressure Plates And TNT.
